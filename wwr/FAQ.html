                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Absolutely, this is a good trip for children of all ages. However, we have found that children over the age of 8 tend to enjoy it more. A common concern from parents is that children will be bored on the boat for hours, but surprisingly, very few children of any age end up bored. The beautiful surroundings, unpredictable wildlife, and exciting rapids keep everyone engaged. Plus, each boat has a guide, and they love sharing stories (some of which are even true!).</p>

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>As with any adventure sport, there is an element of risk. To ensure your safety, our guides are certified in Wilderness First Aid, with at least 3 years of rafting experience. The most common injuries are sunburns and minor land-based injuries. All participants wear coast guard-approved life vests or personal flotation devices (PFDs). Many non-swimmers go on rafting trips and enjoy it fully! Your guide will provide a detailed safety briefing before the trip begins.</p>

                    <p>We provide all necessary camping equipment: sleeping bag, foam pad, waterproof duffle bag, day bag, tent, cot, eating utensils, and a camping chair. Water and lemonade are provided during the day, with coffee, tea, and hot chocolate available in the morning and evening. You may bring up to two cans of beer or soft drinks per day. We also provide three meals per day, plus snacks.</p>

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>We recommend bringing clothes for both hot and cool weather, including a rain jacket and rain pants, quick-dry shirts and shorts, a hat with a strap, sunglasses, socks, sandals or water shoes, a water bottle, sunscreen, and a small day pack for hikes. Personal items like a flashlight, headlamp, hygiene products, a small pillow, and any optional items for comfort are also advised.</p>

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Each day on the river is a unique adventure. Start with a hearty breakfast under the morning sky, then spend the day navigating rapids, calm waters, hikes, and scenic landscapes, with plenty of history and geology to discover. We arrive at camp in the late afternoon, where you can relax and enjoy a delicious dinner by the river. The experience is unforgettable, with starlit nights, good food, and stories by the campfire.</p>

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>If you have specific dates in mind, we recommend booking a year in advance. For those with more flexibility, 6 months in advance is usually enough.</p>
