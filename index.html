    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>My degree is Software Engineering and I like playing Magic the Gathering and sports.</p>
    <p>My favorite scripture right now is 3 Nephi 1:13</p>
    <p>13 Lift up your head and be of good cheer; for behold, the time is at hand, and on this night shall the sign be given, and on the morrow come I into the world, to show unto the world that I will fulfil all that which I have caused to be spoken by the mouth of my holy prophets.</p>
